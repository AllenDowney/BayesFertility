Period fertility rates (Total Fertility Rate, or TFR) provide a snapshot of births in a given year, but they can be influenced by timing effects—women delaying childbearing can depress TFR even if lifetime fertility remains unchanged.\n\nCohort fertility rates provide a more stable measure of long-term reproductive patterns by following specific birth cohorts throughout their reproductive years.

Conclusions"},"content":"This project demonstrates the value of Bayesian methods for demographic projection:\n\nFertility is declining for recent cohorts, with potential for CFR below replacement level\n\nModel validation shows good agreement with historical data, increasing confidence in projections\n\nResampling approach successfully handles survey weights in a Bayesian framework\n\nUncertainty quantification is essential for understanding projection reliability\n\nThe projected decline in cohort fertility has important implications for population dynamics, economic planning, and social policy. While substantial uncertainty remains for incomplete cohorts, the model provides a principled framework for projecting future fertility based on historical patterns.","type":"content","url":"/tech-report#id-6-conclusions","position":55},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Technical Report: Bayesian Fertility Rate Projections","lvl2":"References"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/tech-report#references","position":56},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Technical Report: Bayesian Fertility Rate Projections","lvl2":"References"},"content":"[To be added]\n\nIPUMS CPS: \n\nhttps://​cps​.ipums​.org/\n\nUS Census Bureau Fertility Data\n\nRelevant demographic literature on cohort fertility","type":"content","url":"/tech-report#references","position":57},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Technical Report: Bayesian Fertility Rate Projections","lvl2":"Appendix: Code and Reproducibility"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/tech-report#appendix-code-and-reproducibility","position":58},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"Technical Report: Bayesian Fertility Rate Projections","lvl2":"Appendix: Code and Reproducibility"},"content":"All code for this project is available at: \n\nhttps://​github​.com​/AllenDowney​/BayesFertility\n\nKey notebooks:\n\nnotebooks/process_cps.ipynb: Data preprocessing pipeline\n\nnotebooks/fertility_cps2.ipynb: Model fitting and analysis (v2.0)\n\nnotebooks/fertility_cps3.ipynb: Model fitting and analysis (v3.0)\n\nRequirements:\n\nPython 3.8+\n\nPyMC 5.0+\n\nArviZ, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib\n\nSee requirements.txt for full dependencies.","type":"content","url":"/tech-report#appendix-code-and-reproducibility","position":59}]}
