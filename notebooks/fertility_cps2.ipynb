    "## The Model\n",
    "\n",
    "For the most recent generations, we have limited data.\n",
    "To project what future fertility rates will look like, we'll use a model to estimate cohort and age effects, then use the model to generate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following PyMC model is based on a log-linear model of age cohort effects -- that is, each cohort has a latent value, $\\alpha$, that indicates their overall proclivity to have children, and each age group has a latent value, $\\beta$, that indicates the tendency of people to have children at that age.\n",
    "\n",
    "The average number of children borne by a particular cohort during a given 3-year span is $\\lambda = \\exp \\alpha + \\beta$.\n",
    "So the average parity of a cohort at a given age is the cumulative sum of these rates up to their current age.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are modeled with a Gaussian random walk, which indicates that we expect the difference between successive cohorts, and between successive age groups, to follow a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "As a result, each value is estimated relative to its predecessor, so in the absence of enough data to infer a change, each value is presumed to be unchanged.\n",
    "We'll see the consequences of this structure in the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of $\\alpha$ are constrained so their mean is 0.\n",
    "This is useful because the location of the $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ coefficients is arbitrary; this constraint establishes a zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, if we are given the size and expected parity of a cohort-age group, we expect the observed data to follow a Poisson distribution with the given mean."
