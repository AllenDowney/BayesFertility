# US Fertility Is Heading for Historic Lows

Recent generations of Americans are on track to have fewer children than previous generations. Based on projections from a Bayesian model, cohorts born in the 2000s could end up with fewer than 1 child per woman on average—a level of fertility comparable to present-day South Korea.

The following figure shows the results from the model for US women born from 1920 to 2009, along with observed cohort fertility rates (CFR) from Census data.

![CFR Predictions](figs/cfr_vs_actual_v3.png)

* Fertility peaked with the cohort born in 1934, who had 3.1 children per woman.
* The cohort born in 1980 have 1.9 children on average, having reached the end of their childbearing years.
* Women born in 1990 might have 1.4 children on average, based on data up to age 34 and the model's projections.
* Women born in 2000 might have only 0.9 children on average, based on data up to age 24 and projections.

The shaded area is a credible interval for the projections, showing increasing uncertainty for the youngest cohorts.

Note that this figure shows completed cohort fertility rates (CFR) not total fertility rates (TFR). [This article explains the difference](https://ourworldindata.org/total-fertility-rate-births-per-woman).

## How the Model Works

These projections are based on a Bayesian hierarchical model that and data from the [CPS Fertility Supplement](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-fertility.html), which includes 1.17 million women observed during 1976-2024 at ages 15-54. The model estimates two key parameters:

* **Cohort effects (α)**: For each 3-year cohort group, this parameter quantifies overall fertility level.
* **Age effects (β)**: For each 3-year age group, this parameter quantifies age-specific fertility.

The model uses a log-linear structure:

$$\log(\lambda_{ij}) = \alpha_i + \beta_j$$

where $\lambda_{ij}$ is the expected birth rate for cohort $i$ at age $j$ (Poisson intensity, births per woman-year). The parameters are on a log scale, so they're not easy to interpret in absolute terms. Instead, we should think of them as differences in fertility between groups.

## Cohort and age effects

The next figure shows the cohort effects—that is, a fertility level for each generation.

The cohort effects capture the overall fertility level for each generation. 

* Fertility was highest among the cohorts born between 1925 and 1940, who were the parents of the Baby Boomers.
* Fertility was lower but mostly unchanged among cohorts born between 1950 and 1985.
* Estimated fertility declines substantially among cohorts born after 1985.

The next figure shows the age effects—the typical age pattern of childbearing.

![Age Effects](figs/age_effects_v3.png)

The age effects show that fertility peaks in the mid-20s and declines thereafter.

By combining cohort and age effects, we can project lifetime fertility for cohorts still in their reproductive years.
This version of the model does not take into account timing effects, but we will explore a version that does -- and see that it does not affect the predictions much.

## Assumptions and Validation

We can validate the model on cohorts who have already completed their childbearing. The first figure above shows the model's predictions and observed completed fertility from CPS data. The agreement is very good.

But for the youngest cohorts we have limited data.
For the cohort born in 2000, we've only observed them from ages 15-24, covering just one-third of their reproductive span. For those born in 2009, we've only seen age 15—about 3% of their total reproductive years.

Projections for these cohorts rely on the model's assumptions, not just on observed data. The model uses Gaussian random walks to model generational changes -- which assumes that in the absence of evidence, each cohort will be similar to the previous one. 

Importantly, the model does not extrapolate declining trends -- that is, it doesn't assume the recent decline will continue indefinitely -- but it also doesn't assume trends will reverse. For the youngest cohorts, the projections level off rather than continuing downward. 

Going forward, if something changes dramatically—new policies, economic shifts, cultural reversals—actual fertility could differ substantially from these projections.

## Model Extensions

I also tested an extended version of the model (v4) that accounts for timing shifts—whether cohorts are having children earlier or later than the typical age pattern.

The extended model adds a timing parameter (γ):

$$\log(\lambda_{ij}) = \alpha_i + \beta_j + \gamma_i \times \text{age}_j$$

where $\gamma_i$ is a cohort-specific parameter that tilts the age-fertility curve. Positive values of $\gamma$ mean delayed childbearing (fertility shifts to older ages), while negative values mean earlier childbearing (fertility shifts to younger ages).

The extended model fits the data better, but the projections it produces are not substantially different. The following figure shows the differences.

Details of the extended model are in the [Technical Report](tech_report.md).

## Summary

Using Bayesian methods and nearly 50 years of fertility data, we can project cohort fertility rates for generations still in their reproductive years. The model predicts imminent declines to historically unprecedented levels.

These projections should be interpreted as "what we expect if recent patterns persist." Of course, decisions about childbearing respond to changing circumstances -- but demographic trends have momentum. They don't reverse quickly or easily.
Unless something changes substantially and soon, US fertility is heading for historic lows.


## Possible Objections and Responses

*Objection:* CPS fertility data undercounts births, especially among disadvantaged groups.
Response: This analysis uses the CPS variable “children ever born” (FREVER), which records cumulative parity rather than recent birth events. Parity is generally reported accurately at all ages, especially compared to annual birth measures.

*Objection:* You are assuming recent fertility declines will continue indefinitely.
Response: The model does not impose a continued decline. Cohort effects are modeled as a Gaussian random walk, which assumes future cohorts will resemble recent ones in the absence of evidence. For the youngest cohorts, projections level off rather than continuing downward.

*Objection:* Fertility timing has shifted later; these cohorts may still “catch up.”
Response: An extended model that explicitly accounts for cohort-specific timing shifts fits the data better but produces similar completed fertility projections. Delayed childbearing alone is insufficient to explain the observed declines in cohort fertility.

*Objection:* Immigration and compositional changes could raise future fertility.
Response: Immigration affects period fertility rates more than completed cohort fertility. Immigrant fertility in the US has also declined substantially, and second-generation fertility converges quickly toward native-born levels. Large, sustained changes would be required to materially change these cohort projections.

*Objection:* Economic or policy changes (childcare, housing, parental leave) could reverse the trend.
Response: That is possible. The projections should be interpreted as conditional on current conditions persisting. But demographic trends exhibit inertia, and historically, large fertility reversals have been slow and rare even in the presence of policy interventions.

*Objection:* A log-linear age–cohort model is too simple to capture fertility dynamics.
Response: The model is intentionally parsimonious and is validated on cohorts with completed fertility. More complex models improve in-sample fit but do not materially change the projections for completed cohort fertility.

*Objection:* CFR below 1 is implausibly low.
Response: CFR measures the average number of children per woman across the entire cohort, including women with no children. CFRs below 1 are already observed in several high-income countries, including South Korea, and are demographically feasible.

*Objection:* Survey weighting via resampling is ad hoc.
Response: Resampling using survey weights is a standard approximation for incorporating complex survey designs in Bayesian models. The approach is documented in the technical report, and validation against external Census data suggests it performs well for this application.

**DATA AND METHODS**: The analysis uses [CPS Fertility Supplement](https://www.census.gov/data/datasets/time-series/demo/cps/cps-supp_cps-repwgt/cps-fertility.html) data from 1976-2024, covering 1.17 million women aged 15-54. The model is a Bayesian hierarchical log-linear model with Gaussian random walk priors, fit using PyMC. The model accounts for survey weights by resampling and was validated against historical cohort fertility tables.
